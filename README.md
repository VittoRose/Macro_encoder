 
# HID Encoder with Arduino IDE and RP2040 Zero
## Overview
This project provides the firmware and hardware designs for creating a Human Interface Device (HID) Encoder using the RP2040 Zero microcontroller and Arduino IDE. The encoder can be utilized in various applications such as custom keyboards, MIDI controllers, or any other device that requires an encoder input.

## Repository Contents
* Firmware: Source code written in C++ for the Arduino IDE, tailored for the RP2040 Zero.
* Hardware Schematics: Detailed circuit diagrams and PCB layouts for fabricating the encoder hardware.
* 3D Models: STL files for 3D printing the enclosure and other mechanical components of the encoder.
## Features
**pass**
## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
* Arduino IDE: Ensure you have the latest version installed.
* RP2040 Board Support: Add the RP2040 board package to your Arduino IDE. Follow the instructions on the Arduino official website.
* Required Libraries: Install any additional libraries as specified in the libraries.txt file included in the repository.
### Hardware
* PCB Fabrication: Use the provided schematics and PCB layout files to fabricate your printed circuit board.
* Components: Gather all required electronic components
    - 1x RP2040 Zero
    - 1x Encoder with switch
    - 2x 15 ohm resistor, 1x 45 ohm resistor
    - 1x RGB LED tht

* Assembly: Solder the components onto the PCB as per the schematics.
### Software
Upload Macro_encoder.ino to your RP2040

### 3D Printing
